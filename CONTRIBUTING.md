# Contributing to Agentic Context Engineering Toolkit

Thanks for your interest in Agentic Context Systems! This framework is being built iteratively; please coordinate major changes with the maintainers before submitting a pull request.

## Getting Set Up
1. Fork the repository and clone it locally.
2. Create and activate a Python 3.12 virtual environment.
3. Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Confirm tooling works: `black --version`, `ruff --version`, `mypy --version`.

## Development Standards
- Keep the code typed (`mypy --strict`) and formatted (`black`).
- Run `ruff check` before submitting.
- Document new public APIs in `docs/` and add examples when helpful.
- Coordinate on naming and module layout to preserve the project structure.

## Pull Request Checklist
- [ ] Linting/formatting/type checks pass.
